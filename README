ATOMIC CIRCULAR-BUFFER PIPE  IMPLEMENTATIONS (UNIX)

	The buffer have an ATOMIC

		
	-thread safe
	-NON BLOCKING
	-VECTORED read,write


	------------------------------------------------------------

	1) conduct.c is not concurrent and not lock-free

			MODE_MEMCPY at TRUE use memcpy standard C library function else it don't

	------------------------------------------------------------

	2) concurrentconduct.c is concurrent and not lock-free  (Writer and Reader can use at the same time the Circular-Buffer)

			it use ATOMIC OPERATIONS
			there is 2 implementation possible :

			MPMC ->  multiple producer multiple consumer solutions
			SPSC ->  single producer single consumer solutions
